# Continous integration code + data model with Oracle and Liquibase

## Goals

![GIT Branches pipeline methodlogy|100x100](https://zepel.io/blog/content/images/2020/05/feature-branch-with-develop-git-workflow-2.png)

This sample shows how to integrate a standard code continous integration pipeline with the changes in the data model for Oracle databases

For this, we need to convert the data model (DDL) into comparable and autogenerated code. For this, we use liquibase, integrated in the new Oracle SQLcl command line interface.

For this test, we do the following assumptions:

### CI methodology:
We use a very common standard methdology, based in GIT source code control. 

Rules:

- The developers work in a specific environment, with a specific branch (in our case)
- The promotion environments (qa, pre, pro) have its own branches, BUT NOBODY code in these branches
- For promote from one environment to the upper one (one step by time), we use the merge command
- For label the versions in every environment we use GIT tags. And also, we use these tags for de-promote
- Addtional developments create its own branches, with the rules:
  - Features create new branches from dev branch
  - Hotfixes create new branches from production branch (or upper environment) but require always merging with dev branch too 


# WORK IN PROGRESS
BE AWARE: A LOT OF HARDCODED PARAMETERS!

## Install dependencies
The following dependencies has to be intalled prior the sample. 
We recommend always to use a package manager.

In our case, we are using MacOS and Homebrew as package manager, so the installation commans will use this.
### Tools / Commands
* [Download your jq flavor](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) 

  MacOS
  ```
  brew install jq
  ```

### Java
* Check your installed java version. this sample requires Java 11 or later
* Download the JDBC drivers maching the Java version and the Oracle Database version used. In this sample we are using openjdk@11 and Autonomous Database for JSON, currently using 19c. So, dowload ojdbc10 version from [here](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/jdbc-ucp-19-10-c-downloads.html)

### Gradle
* [Download your Gradle flavor](https://gradle.org/install/) 

  MacOS
  ```
  brew install gradle
  ```

### Jenkins
* [Download your Jenkins flavor](https://www.jenkins.io/download/)

  OSX Homebrew
  ```
  brew install jenkins-lts
  brew services start jenkins-lts
  ```
* Configure
  Get generated admin password from user home directory
  ```
  cat ~/.jenkins/secrets/initialAdminPassword
  ```

* Connect to http://localhost:8080 to end configuration. Paste the admin password, and select initial set of plugins
* Create administrator user and password. Optionally, set the e-mail address
* Set the Jenkins URL. Notice: The change in MacOS can be a little tricky, check this [StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7139338/change-jenkins-port-on-macos)

* Navigate to [tools configuration](http://localhost:8181/configureTools/) and add your gradle folder

### SQLcl
* Download last version of SQLcl from [here](https://www.oracle.com/tools/downloads/sqlcl-downloads.html)
* Uncompress the downloaded zip file in a local directory, and add the sql script to path

	MacOS

  ```
  sudo unzip ~/Downloads/sqlcl-21.1.0.104.1544.zip -d /usr/local/opt/
  echo 'export PATH=/usr/local/opt/sqlcl/bin:$PATH' >> .bash_profile
  ```

### Springboot CLI
* [Install SpringBoot client](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/getting-started.html#getting-started-installing-spring-boot)

  OSX Homebrew
	```
	brew tap spring-io/tap
	brew install spring-boot
  ```

### LiquidBase

* [Install your Liquibase CLI flavor](https://www.liquibase.org/download)

  OSX Homebrew

	```
	brew install gcc
	brew install liquibase
	liquibase --help
	```

* [Download the Oracle JDBC drivers version 10](https://www.oracle.com/database/technologies/appdev/jdbc-downloads.html) and copy to liquibase lib directory. NOTICE: Use jdbc10 drivers, jdbc8 does not work!!!

  OSX Homebrew

  ```
  cd /usr/local/Cellar/liquibase/4.3.4/libexec/lib
  cp ~/Downloads/ojdbc8-full.tar.gz .
  tar -xvzf ojdbc10-full.tar.gz
  mv OJDBC8-Full/* .
  rm -rf OJDBC8-Full/
  ```



## Build application sample (version 1)
### Provision an OCI Autonomous Database
OCI Autonomous Database (henceforth ADB) can be provisioned using the [oci console](https://cloud.oracle.com) or oci cli commands.
You will need the following parameters:
* Optional: If you use several profiles for OCI (e.g., you manage several accounts, ensure you know the name and use the correct --profile command line option)
* Compartment OCID: If required and you are allowed, create a comparment for this test. 

  If not, ask you OCI administrator for a compartment ID
* DB admin password: As we are going to expose this database to public internet choose wisely!


Using OCI CLI, you can create the autonomous database as


```
oci db autonomous-database create \
  --profile EMEASPAINSANDBOX \
  --compartment-id ocid1.compartment.oc1..aaaaaaaadanfxejgerljyzontldg275quuf4sdc4pel52z67f64nas7xrm5q \
  --cpu-core-count 1 \
  --data-storage-size-in-tbs 1 \
  --db-name lbtest \
  --admin-password 1UPPERCASE#1lowercase \
  --db-version 19c \
  --db-workload AJD \
  --display-name "LiquidBase sample database" \
  --license-model LICENSE_INCLUDED \
  --wait-for-state AVAILABLE
```

After creation, download the wallet for connection

```
export ADB_ID=$(oci db autonomous-database list \
  --profile EMEASPAINSANDBOX \
  --compartment-id ocid1.compartment.oc1..aaaaaaaadanfxejgerljyzontldg275quuf4sdc4pel52z67f64nas7xrm5q \
  --display-name "LiquidBase sample database" \
  |jq -r ".data[0].id")

oci db autonomous-database generate-wallet \
  --profile EMEASPAINSANDBOX \
  --autonomous-database-id $ADB_ID \
  --password 1UPPERCASE#1lowercase \
  --file keystore/wallet.zip \
  --generate-type SINGLE 
```

* Uncompress the wallet in a well-known directory

* Connect with your SQLcl tool, and create 2 users, corresponding to dev and pre environments. The pre user is 'editioned', so it can connect to 2 different editions
  ```
  export TNS_ADMIN='./keystore/wallet'
  sql admin/1UPPERCASE#1lowercase@lbtest_tp <<-'EOF'

  CREATE EDITION EDITION_MAIN AS CHILD OF ORA$BASE;
  ALTER DATABASE DEFAULT EDITION = EDITION_MAIN;
  GRANT USE ON EDITION EDITION_MAIN TO PUBLIC;
  GRANT USE ON EDITION EDITION_TEST TO PUBLIC;
  ALTER DATABASE DEFAULT EDITION = EDITION_MAIN;

  CREATE USER dev IDENTIFIED BY UPPERCASE1lowercase;
  GRANT CREATE SESSION TO dev;
  GRANT DWROLE TO dev;
  GRANT UNLIMITED TABLESPACE TO dev;
  ALTER USER dev ENABLE EDITIONS;
  GRANT CREATE ANY EDITION, DROP ANY EDITION TO dev;    
  GRANT SELECT ON DBA_EDITIONS TO dev;  

  CREATE USER pre IDENTIFIED BY UPPERCASE1lowercase;
  GRANT CREATE SESSION TO pre;
  GRANT DWROLE TO pre;
  GRANT UNLIMITED TABLESPACE TO pre;
  ALTER USER pre ENABLE EDITIONS;
  GRANT CREATE ANY EDITION, DROP ANY EDITION TO pre;  
  GRANT SELECT ON DBA_EDITIONS TO pre;
  -- Only during development, enable debug
  GRANT DEBUG ANY PROCEDURE TO pre;
  GRANT DEBUG CONNECT SESSION TO pre;
  GRANT EXECUTE ON DBMS_DEBUG_JDWP TO pre;

  quit
	EOF

  ```



### Create a SpringBoot sample project
* Create an empty SpringBoot project, using the [initializr](https://start.spring.io/) wizard or directly using `spring init` command.
* Add dependencies for web management, persistence,oracle database drivers and actuator (web,data-jpa,oracle,actuator,validation,devtools)

```
spring init --build=gradle --dependencies=web,data-jpa,oracle,actuator,validation,devtools  application
```

* Edit `build.gradle` generated file, and add oracle drivers additiinal depedencies (ojdbc8 artifact has to be already there)
```
// Oracle Database Drivers
implementation 'com.oracle.database.jdbc:ojdbc8'
implementation 'com.oracle.database.jdbc:ucp'	
implementation 'com.oracle.database.security:oraclepki'
implementation 'com.oracle.database.security:osdt_cert'
implementation 'com.oracle.database.security:osdt_core'
```

* Add a Oracle Datasource Configuration bean (see code in repository)

* Add an entity POJO class, mapping the PRODUCT table (see code in repository)

* Add a CRUD repository interfaces for finding and delete by primary key  in Product Entity (see code in repository)

* Add a controller for read, create and delete product (see code in repository)

* Edit the application properties file, and set url (pointing to the wallet), user, password and oracle hibernate dialect (see code in repository)
  * Check the URL: The name is based in dbname + service level, and the address of the wallet is relative to execution directoy. Remember we are using 2 copies of wallet: Use the copy correponding to application (copy uncompressed and unedited)

### Liquibase
* Generate the project folder structure
```
  mkdir <myproject>/database
  mkdir <myproject>/database/changelogs
  mkdir <myproject>/database/scripts
```

* Create a `liquibase.properties` file in `database` directory, with the parameters to connect to database and to identify the master changelog file. Verify:

  * The database id (normally, the name of database created + connection service)
  * The `TNS_ADMIN` parameter, pointing to the downloaded walled
  * The database user and password
  * The location of changelog master file

  ```
  driver=oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver
  url=jdbc:oracle:thin:@lbtest_tp?TNS_ADMIN=/Users/jmalbarran/Projects/ORA/ORA/PoC_LiquidBase/oracle-liquibase/keystore/wallet
  username=admin
  password=1UPPERCASE#1lowercase
  changeLogFile=changelogs/master.xml
  logLevel=debug
  liquibase.hub.mode=off	
  ```

* Create a master change log file with `master.xml` in changelogs
  ```
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> 
  <databaseChangeLog
    xmlns="http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog"
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
    xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog
                        http://www.liquibase.org/xml/ns/dbchangelog/dbchangelog-3.9.xsd">

  </databaseChangeLog>
  ```

* Tag the initial state (empty database) as v0
  ```
  liquibase tag v0
  ```

* If everything runs fine (`Liquibase command 'tag' was executed successfully.`), you can check your database schema, and check the contents of the new tables: `DATABASECHANGELOG` and `DATABASECHANGELOGLOCK`. The table DATABASECHANGELOG will contain only one record, with the tagging

* Create the initial database scripts in folder scripts. Suggested an independent script per object. In this sample, the v1 includes an script for create a sample table (`CreateTable_Product.sql`), and script for creating a function (`CreateFunction_ProductCount.sql`).

* Create a v1 changelog (`changelog_00001_setup_product.xml`) with a changeset per every sql script. Please, notice:
  * The changeset will be applied in the order they are in the changelog
  * Be aware of the splitStatement attribute. The function has to have this attribute to false, because is a single statement with multiple ';' in it

  ```
  <?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
  <databaseChangeLog ...>
    <changeSet id="000010" author="Jose Manuel Albarran">
      <sqlFile 
        dbms="oracle"
        endDelimiter=";"
        path="../scripts/CreateTable_Product.sql"
        relativeToChangelogFile="true" 
        splitStatements="true"
        stripComments="false"/>
    </changeSet>
    <changeSet id="000020" author="Jose Manuel Albarran">
      <sqlFile 
        dbms="oracle"
        endDelimiter=";"
        path="../scripts/CreateFunction_ProductCount.sql"
        relativeToChangelogFile="true" 
        splitStatements="false"
        stripComments="false"/>
    </changeSet>	
  </databaseChangeLog>	
  ```

* For processing the changelogs in order, there are 2 ALTERNATIVES
  * Include ALL files in the `changelog` folder. In this case be aware that the files will be processed following the file name order. In this case add the line `<includeAll path="./changelogs"/>` to the master file.
  * Include change log files in the master file, one by one, and in order. In this case, we have added the following to the master file `	<include file="./changelog_00001_setup_product.xml" relativeToChangelogFile="true" />`

* Process the initial creation with

  ```
  liquibase update
  ```

* If everything runs fine (`Liquibase: Update has been successful.`), you can check your database schema, and check the contents of the new tables: `DATABASECHANGELOG` and `DATABASECHANGELOGLOCK`

* End the process tagging this version with the command
  ```
  liquibase tag v1
  ```
